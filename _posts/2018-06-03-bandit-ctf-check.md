This phrase has been overused to death to promote hands-on learning, but that's because it's true. It's also what I've learnt while playing the Bandit CTF. 

### the ctf

The [Bandit CTF](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) on [Overthewire](http://overthewire.org/) is often recommended to Infosec newbies. The CTF aims to get you up and running with Linux & CTFs(Capture the Flag). The Bandit CTF is extra welcoming to CTF & Linux newbies because it holds your hand as your progress, giving you the name of commands to learn in order to obtain the current level’s flags.

### resources
For most challenges, learning how to Google and learning to read man pages will get you through. Don't look at the writeups yet though, that takes the fun away.

As for me, there's 2 Linux books sitting on my shelf, which I could never read past the first few chapters. Because with no practice exercises to go along, they can get pretty dry, and sadly half the time they end up being bedtime reading material (not the authors' fault, all mine :D)

Now, with Bandit added in the mix, learning Linux with the books got exciting!

### the play

After completing a level, I'd check out write-ups posted online. Different people think differently so there's various methods to get the flags. Some challenges were simple, and some were tough which got me stuck for hours. That's when I'd start peeking at hints for the next step. _#shame_. Every night that I managed to get play time, it'd end up with me sleeping late, and saying "_just 1 more level..._" 

### the end
I reached the final level (25) after a month (_Cough_, work was really busy in May), and boy was it a satisfying feeling!

This text from the final level brought a little sadness, just like watching the last episode of a good TV series that got cancelled abruptly.

I made notes in Onenote as I progressed, so here’s a mind map I compiled in Mindjet with all the commands used in this CTF.

### conclusion and next steps
As for me, my Linux journey continues on, as there’s still 3 quarters of both books left to finish. RHCSA, I'm looking at you.

So, Bandit CTF - I highly recommend this as CTF 101 for a beginner as it gave me familiarity with Linux Command Line basics. If you're still hesitating, I dare you to try the first few levels! You're gonna be hooked :) Even if you've been Linux-ing for years, there might new tricks for you to pick up. _(...says my friend who completed bandit together with me)_
