title: Natas Web App CTF - Lvl 1 - 16
---

I’m on another OvertheWire CTF - Natas, which focuses on WebApps. Made it to level 16 and it’s been great fun so far getting flags while improving scripting skills.
The hand-holding style of Bandit however, is not present here. Because  the hints that come in the form of ‘required reading’ are not provided at each level.
I am not going to do write-ups as there are plenty of good walkthroughs on various blogs and Youtube already (I highly recommend John Hammond’s channel because it guides you thrugh a nice python scripting workflow using Sublime).
Here however, I present to you my version of handholding. Hope this helps you, especially if you don't want a full blown walkthrough, but just need a little nudge in the right direction.
