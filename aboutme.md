### why blog?

I'm documenting my InfoSec journey and other loves here (Eg. food in Malaysia, Music). It's part of my bigger goal of hanging up my lurker mantle spending 2 decades on the internet, with the hopes that my sharing will benefit you, just as I have benefited from the content of others.

### a short history

As a young boy, I was known as the computer guy among my friends, yet all I wanted was to be a guitar hero. Coming as a surprise to most, I spent the next 7 years dabbling in the arts of accounting & audit, and qualified as a Chartered Accountant.

_In 2015_, I took the [CS50x course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), which sparked a long lost computery excitement. Fueled foward by the fun I was having, I decided to make it my career. Firstly by tackling the Security+ and [CISA](http://www.isaca.org/CERTIFICATION/CISA-CERTIFIED-INFORMATION-SYSTEMS-AUDITOR/Pages/default.aspx) certification, and there began my journey to become an Infosec Professional. 

I’m a fan of structured learning, which includes books, certification, Pluralsight/SANS courses..., especially when starting out. That's because I believe solid foundations are **really** important for making good decisions.

### the journey so far
Tech Certifications I have under my name so far: CISA, CompTIA’s Security+, CCNA CyberOps, SANs GCCC. Please don't label me as a cert hoarder just yet, I'm just a guy that's thankful for being blessed with loads of training opportunities!

**My current focus** -- Improving technical hands on penetration testing skills for Web and Net, with OSCP in my sights for 2019.
