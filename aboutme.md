### Why the blog?

The first half of my life, I was the go-to computer guy among my friends, and all I wanted was to be a guitar hero. Strangely, I spent the next 7 years dabbling in the arts of accounting & audit, and ended up became a Chartered Accountant.
2015 – I enrolled for the CS50x course on edX, and it sparked a long lost excitement. Fuelled with fond memories of all the nerdy computery fun I had in my childhood, I started looking at options to return to my first interest, and took the CISA certification (as it offered generous exemptions to accountants), and there began my journey to become an Infosec Professional.
I’m a total fan of structured learning (Textbooks, Pluralsight courses, SANs training, etc) as I believe solid foundations are key to making good contextual decisions. This interest in learning shows when I constantly introduce(bug) friends & colleagues to take up free training resources, or nudge them to study alongside with me. Certifications I have taken & passed so far are: ACCA, CISA, CompTIA’s Security+, CyberOps. For hands on experience to catch up with my peers, I run an ESXi homelab, coupled with free cloud credits from GCP, Azure & AWS.
This site was created to document my InfoSec learning journey and other ventures that excite me (such as Bass playing, and good food in Malaysia). After lurking on the internet for 20+ years, it’s time to create some content with the hopes that they might benefit you , just as I have benefited from the content of others.
